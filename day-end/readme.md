The script will run commands for every path found in paths file.
Each path should be on a different line

### Step 1 - git status
For all paths in ~/.config/day-end/day-end.paths the command 'git status' will be executed. The output will be parsed to check if all changes are commited

### Step 2 - kpcli
It's based on the fact that while kpcli application is running a *.lock file exists at the same location

### Step 3 - toggle
Config file must exists ~/.config/day-end/config.ini. Should contain section [toggle] with user and pass properties. These will be used to connect to toggle account. The most recent entry will be checked if it has stop time property greater then 0.

### Step 4 - last sync
